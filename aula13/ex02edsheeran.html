				<h1>Ed Sheeran<br>Celestial</h1>
                <p>
You see, tonight, it could go either way<br>
Hearts balanced on a razor blade<br>
We are designed to love and break<br>
And to rinse and repeat it all again<br><br>

I get stuck when the world's too loud<br>
And things don't look up when you're goin' down<br>
I know your arms are reachin' out<br>
From somewhere beyond the clouds<br><br>

You make me feel<br>
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away<br>
You make me feel<br>
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out into space<br>
Celestial<br>
Celestial<br><br>

I see the light shinin' through the rain<br>
A thousand colors in a brighter shade<br>
Needed to rise from the lowest place<br>
There's a silver lining that surrounds the grey<br><br>

When I get lost, will it come back around?<br>
Things don't look up when you're goin' down<br>
I know your arms, they are reachin' out<br>
From somewhere beyond the clouds<br><br>

You make me feel<br>
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away<br>
You make me feel<br>
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out into space<br>
Celestial<br>
Celestial, oh-oh<br><br>

We were made to be<br>
Nothin' more than this<br>
Finding magic in all the smallest things<br>
The way we notice, that's what really matters<br>
Let's make tonight go on and on and on<br><br>

You make me feel<br>
(We were made to be nothing more than this)<br>
(Finding magic in all the smallest things)<br>
You make me feel<br>
(The way we notice, that's what really matters)<br>
(Let's make tonight go on and on and on)<br><br>

You make me feel<br>
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away<br>
You make me feel<br>
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out into space<br>
Celestial, oh-oh<br>
Celestial, oh-oh<br>
Celestial<br><br>

We were made to be<br>
Nothing more than this (oh-oh)<br>
Finding magic in all the smallest things (celestial)<br>
The way we notice, that's what really matters (oh-oh)<br>
Let's make tonight go on and on and on<br>
Celestial<br><br>
